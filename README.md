# 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning

it is a type of Machine Learning where the model learns patterns and relationships in data without using labeled outputs.

🔹 Main Types of Unsupervised Learning:
(1) Clustering – grouping similar data points together
📍 Example: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering
(2) Dimensionality Reduction – simplifying data by reducing the number of features
📍 Example: PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE
(3) Association Rule Learning – finding relationships between variables
📍 Example: Market Basket Analysis (like “People who buy bread also buy butter”)

💡 Future Work
(1) Add advanced clustering methods (Gaussian Mixture, SOM)
(2) Include large real-world datasets
(3) Integrate autoencoders for deep unsupervised learning
